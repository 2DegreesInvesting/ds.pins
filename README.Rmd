The goal of this meetup is to show how we might share different versions of an
evolving dataset as pins with Dropbox.

Compared to a previous meetup about pins, this one uses [pins
1.0.0](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/pins-1-0-0/), which includes a new more
explicit API and greater support for versioning.

At the end of this series you will be able to do two things:

* Read data from a shared folder on Dropbox.
* Use different versions of an evolving, dataset.

I will also show briefly how to publish pins to a board on Dropbox.

## Who is the audience?

Analysts and developers at 2DII and beyond.

## Why is this important?

We need a way to easily share different versions of an evolving dataset and
ensure new versions of the data don't break existing code.

> The pins package makes it easy to share R objects across projects and with
your colleagues. You can pin objects to a variety of pin boards, including ...
Dropbox. Pins can be automatically versioned, making it straightforward to track
changes, re-run analyses on historical data, and undo mistakes.
